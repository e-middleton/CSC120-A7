- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Cafe: Overloaded sellCoffee, and made it so you can sell coffee with only the size parameter, which just sells black coffee. 

house: Overloaded moveOut(), when it has no parameters, it moves out all the residents (if there are residents) perhaps for an emergency or there's mold in the house and everybody needs to leave.
