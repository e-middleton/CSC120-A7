- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Cafe: Overloaded sellCoffee(), and made it a default order of a hazelnut latte which I've decided is the most popular for this cafe. Then I overloaded it again and made it so when sellCoffee(n) has one parameter, its the size of the coffee and they're ordering black coffee.

house: Overloaded moveOut(), when it has no parameters, it moves out all the residents (if there are residents) perhaps for an emergency or there's mold in the house and everybody needs to leave. Overloaded the constructor to build a house with no parameters. Assumes the house doesn't have a dining room or elevator by default. 

Library: overloaded addTitle() to add 5 titles to a library, maybe this is a default set of books that all library's get as a first shipment, or if nobody can decide which books to add to a library, these are the ones they get. 
Overloaded isAvailable() to just print all the titles that are available at a given time, just in case somebody only wants to browse through the books currently available.
